## Set up API keys

You need [Twitter API keys](https://apps.twitter.com/) for this to work.
After you've set them up, create an `.env` file in the root of this
folder, and add these variables to it (see the `sample.env` for an
example):

```
CONSUMER_KEY='...'
CONSUMER_SECRET='...'
ACCESS_TOKEN='...'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='...'
```

## Make it go

```
npm install
npm start
```
